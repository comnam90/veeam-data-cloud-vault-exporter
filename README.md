## Installation

This extension is not on the Chrome Web Store and must be loaded manually as an "unpacked extension."

### Download the Extension

1. **Download the Latest Release:** Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/comnam90/veeam-data-cloud-vault-exporter/releases/latest) and download the `Source code (zip)` file (e.g., `veeam-data-cloud-vault-exporter-1.0.0.zip`)
2. **Extract the ZIP:** Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer. Remember this location as you'll need it in the next steps.

## Usage

### Basic Export

1. **Log In:** Ensure you are logged into your Veeam Data Cloud account in a browser tab.
2. **Navigate to VDC Vault:** Go to any Veeam Data Cloud **Vault** page (organization dashboard, tenant management, or specific tenant page). **Important:** This extension only works on Vault service pages - if you're on other VDC services, the extension will display a message indicating it's not active on those services.
3. **Open the Extension:** Click the extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar. You may need to click the puzzle piece icon first to find and "pin" it.
4. **Configure Export (Optional):**
   - Check **"Filter by date"** to export only specific months of Vault usage data
   - Check **"Tenants summary only"** for a fast export without detailed vault statistics
5. **Start Export:** Click the **Export to CSV** or **Export Tenant to CSV** button (text varies based on context).
6. **Save the File:** The extension will fetch the Vault data (watch the progress indicator). Once complete, a "Save As" dialog will appear with an automatically generated filename like `veeam_data_cloud_vault_export_2025-10-03.csv`.

### Extension Availability

The extension intelligently adapts based on where you are in your browser:

- **‚úÖ Active on VDC Vault Pages:** When you're on any Veeam Data Cloud Vault page (e.g., `cloud.veeam.com/vault/*`), the extension displays the full export interface with all functionality.

- **‚ö†Ô∏è VDC (Non-Vault) Pages:** If you're logged into VDC but viewing a different service (like M365 or Entra ID), the extension displays a message: "This extension currently only supports Veeam Data Cloud **Vault**. Support for other VDC services may be added in the future."

- **üö´ Non-VDC Websites:** If you open the extension on any other website, it displays: "Sorry, this extension is designed for use with Veeam Data Cloud Vault only. Please go to the portal to use it." with a convenient button to navigate to the VDC Vault portal.

This context-aware behavior ensures you always know why the extension may not be showing the export interface.

## CSV Output Columns

| **UsageTB**              | The storage consumed (in TB) by that vault during that month.                      |

### Summary Export Columns

When using "Tenants summary only" mode, the CSV contains only the Vault tenant-level information (excludes vault-specific columns):

- TenantDisplayName
- TenantId
- TenantStatus
- TenantRegion
- TenantCreatedAt
- SubscriptionId
- SubscriptionEdition
- SubscriptionLimitTB
- SubscriptionExpires
- TenantOverallUsageTB
- TenantVaultCount
- TenantStorageRegions

This provides a quick overview of Vault tenants without the detailed monthly vault statistics.

## Environment Support

This extension works with Veeam Data Cloud when accessing **Vault service** pages at `https://cloud.veeam.com/vault/*`.

**Remember:** The extension will not activate on other VDC service pages (M365, Entra ID, etc.) as it is specifically designed for the Vault service only.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not working?

- **Check your location:** Make sure you're on a Veeam Data Cloud **Vault** page (URL should contain `/vault`)
  - If on a non-Vault VDC service, you'll see a message indicating the extension only supports Vault
  - If on a non-VDC website, you'll see a button to navigate to the VDC portal
- Ensure you're logged into Veeam Data Cloud
- Reload the extension at `chrome://extensions`
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Export taking too long?

- Try using "Tenants summary only" mode for faster results
- Use date filtering to limit the data range

### Failed tenants in export?

- Some tenants may fail to fetch due to API timeouts or permissions
- Failed tenants are included in the CSV with "N/A" values and a warning is shown
- Check the browser console for specific error details
